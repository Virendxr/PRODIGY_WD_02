# ⏱️ Stopwatch Web Application  
A modern stopwatch web app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project lets users measure time with precision, record lap times, and enjoy a sleek, responsive interface enhanced with audio feedback.

# 📝 Overview  
This stopwatch allows users to **start**, **stop**, **reset**, and **record lap times** down to the millisecond. Each lap is displayed in a scrollable, styled list with numbered labels and timestamps. The UI is minimal and professional, designed with a **dark theme** and optional **sound effects** to enhance interactivity.

All logic is written in vanilla JavaScript, with separate functions to manage the timer, update the display, handle laps, and control sounds. CSS handles all the styling — including transitions, custom scrollbars, and hover effects. HTML ensures a clean and accessible structure.
