# ⏱️ Stopwatch Web Application

A modern stopwatch web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows users to measure time with precision, record laps, and enjoy a sleek user interface enhanced with audio feedback and a responsive layout.

# 📝 Overview

This stopwatch lets users start, stop, reset, and record lap times down to the millisecond. Lap times are displayed in a scrollable list with styled lap numbers and timestamps. The interface is minimal, responsive, and designed with a dark professional theme. The app also includes optional audio feedback for a more interactive experience.

All logic is written in **vanilla JavaScript**, with separate functions handling the timer state, display updates, lap recording, and audio control. Styling is done in pure CSS, including smooth transitions, hover effects, and custom scrollbars. The HTML provides a clean structure, keeping accessibility and clarity in mind.
